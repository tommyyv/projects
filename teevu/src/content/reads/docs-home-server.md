and accessed via SSH.

## Apply & Develop

1. Install and boot up a Linux distro onto targeted machine.
2. GPT vs UEFI: Depends on the processor manufacturer year and type of
   processors (Intel, AMD, etc).
3. Configure and setup machine with SSH enabled, port 22; change later for
   security purposes.
4. Connect machine to the local network.
5. SSH into the machine from the local machine.
6. Execute scripts or commands => what can exactly be done?
